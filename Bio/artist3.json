    "bio":"Shawn Mendes is a Canadian pop singer and songwriter. After uploading a series of his cover versions to various video-sharing sites (beginning with the now-defunct application Vine in 2012), Mendes earned a dedicated following that he cultivated through social media outlets. His talent, teen-idol good looks and built-in fan base quickly landed him a record deal. In 2014, his debut single, Life of the Party, charted at No. 24 on the Billboard 100, making the then 15-year-old Mendes the youngest artist to have a debut song in the Top 25.",
